Perform ab testing on grocery website to check user interactions on the UI changes of the website

AB testing is a Basic randomized experiment. It is a way to compare the two versions of a variable to findout ehich performs 
better in a controlled environment.
It is a hypothetical testing for making decisions that estimates population parameters based on sample statistics.

With A/B tests, many features such as being a member of a site, clicking, clicking on advertisements, going to a sale can be tested. In the dataset here, i have observed whether a change made in the web interface of a market increases the number of clicks.
